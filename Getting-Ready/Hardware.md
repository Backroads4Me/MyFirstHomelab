# Getting Started: Choosing Hardware for Your Homelab

So, you’ve decided to build your first homelab—exciting! The first step is choosing the right hardware. The good news is, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Whether you’re repurposing an old computer or investing in specialized equipment, you’ll find a wide range of options to fit your needs and budget.

You'll need two computers for your homelab:
- **Homelab Hardware**: This will act as your server.  You'll need to be able to connect a monitor and keyboard to it for the initial setup.  After that it's useful, but not necessary.
- **Another PC**: You’ll use this to access and configure your homelab.

## The best hardware for your homelab is whatever you already have!
While having the latest hardware is nice, it’s not necessary to begin. Start with what you have on hand and upgrade as your needs evolve. Homelabs are about learning and experimenting, so don’t wait for the “perfect” setup.

## Types of Hardware for Homelabs


### 1. Old Personal Computers
Got an old desktop or laptop lying around? Perfect! Older PCs can often be repurposed as basic servers. These are great for:
- Learning the basics of server setup.
- Hosting lightweight applications.
- Experimenting without investing in new hardware.
---

### 2. Raspberry Pi or Similar Single-Board Computers (SBCs)
Raspberry Pi devices are small, affordable, and incredibly versatile. They’re ideal for running low-resource applications or learning Linux.
- Cheap and energy-efficient.  
- Widely supported by the community.  

*Recommended Models*:  Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB version).

---

### 3. Used Enterprise Server Hardware
Purchasing used servers from platforms like eBay or refurbishers can give you a huge bang for your buck. Look for brands like **Dell PowerEdge**, **HPE ProLiant**, or **Lenovo ThinkSystem**.
- High reliability and excellent performance.  
- Enterprise-grade features like RAID, ECC memory, and redundant power supplies.  

**Cons**:  
- Larger size and higher noise levels.  
- Increased power consumption.  

---

### 4. High-End Custom Builds (not recommended)
If budget isn’t a constraint, building a custom server with modern components can give you the ultimate homelab experience. Use high-performance CPUs (e.g., AMD Ryzen or Intel Xeon), plenty of RAM, and SSDs for blazing-fast storage.
- We highly suggest not going this route for your very first build.
- You will quickly learn more about the features and specs you really want.

---

## What to Look for in Entry-Level Equipment
If you’re just starting out, here are some tips for choosing the right equipment:
- **RAM**: Aim for at least 8GB. More is better for running multiple virtual machines or containers.
- **Storage**: SSDs are recommended for speed, but HDDs are fine for budget setups.
- **CPU**: Look for at least 4 cores and modern architecture (Intel i5/i7 or equivalent AMD Ryzen processors).
- **Age of Hardware**: Avoid systems older than 10 years unless they have been refurbished or meet your specific needs.

---

## When Is Something Too Old or Low Spec?
- If the system has less than 4GB of RAM, it will struggle with most modern workloads.
- Older processors without virtualization support (e.g., Intel Core 2 Duo) may not work for tasks like running virtual machines.
- Avoid hard drives with poor health or components that lack manufacturer support.

Once you’ve got your hardware ready, we’ll move on to the next step: setting up your server!
